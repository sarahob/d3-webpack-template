# d3-webpack-template

This is a very simple starter template to bootstrap a [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) app with webpack. 

The need arose when I wanted a really simple starter app to create some d3 visualizations without a lot of other overhead.

## Configuration includes: 
- dev server with hot reloading ðŸ”¥
- loaders for managing CSS ðŸŽ¨
- loader for managing images ðŸ“¸ 
- loader for managing fonts ðŸ’¬

## How to use:

`npm run start`
This will run the webpack dev config. The dev server will be available on `localhost:8080`. If you make changes to any files the server will reload automatically to reflect the new changes. 

`npm run build`
This will run the webpack prod config. The app will be bundled and available from the `/dist` folder.
